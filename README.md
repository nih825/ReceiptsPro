ReceiptsPro
===========

Android App to store receipts and view analytics of spending 

This is all the code I utilized to create ReceiptsPro the android application.  
Feel free to utilize this code in any way and send me feedback.
The goal of this application was to allow users to take pictures of their receipts and
categorize the expenses into various categories.  This app will then store these receipts
and provide a graph of spending based on expense category.  

I utilized a sqlite database for this application to store the categories and 
timestamps of the receipts along with the path to the location of the picture
of the receipt on the phone.  I utilized android plot for plotting the expenses.  

This repo contains all the code utilized in this project (Android manifest, src files, etc.)
The bulk of the important code is in the src/com/example folder.  Let me know what you think.

Further updates to this app will contain the ability to create emailable expense reports, 
budgets, and more analytics!  Let me know any other cool features you would want in this app!
